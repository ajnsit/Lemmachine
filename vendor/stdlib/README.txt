------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Agda "standard" library
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For information about the library, see README.agda.

The README module imports the Everything module. This module is
generated automatically; if you have downloaded the library from its
darcs repository and want to type check README you can construct
Everything by running "runhaskell GenerateEverything.hs". Note that
the GenerateEverything program depends on the filepath and FileManip
packages from Hackage.

Note that all library sources are located under src. The modules
README and Everything are not really part of the library, so these
modules are located in the top-level directory instead.
