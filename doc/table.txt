* Extended Method Definitions

The set of common methods for HTTP/1.0 is defined below. Although this
set can be expanded, additional methods cannot be assumed to share the
same semantics for separately extended clients and servers.

* Extended Header Fields

Response-Header field names can be extended reliably only in
combination with a change in the protocol version. However, new or
experimental header fields may be given the semantics of response
header fields if all parties in the communication recognize them to be
response header fields. Unrecognized header fields are treated as
Entity-Header fields.

The extension-header mechanism allows additional Entity-Header fields
to be defined without changing the protocol, but these fields cannot
be assumed to be recognizable by the recipient. Unrecognized header
fields should be ignored by the recipient and forwarded by proxies.

* General Header Fields

| Date | Pragma |

* Request Header Fields

|---------------+------+-------------------+---------+------------|
| Authorization | From | If-Modified-Since | Referer | User-Agent |
|---------------+------+-------------------+---------+------------|

* Response Header Fields

|----------+--------+------------------|
| Location | Server | WWW-Authenticate |
|----------+--------+------------------|

* Entity Header Fields

|-------+------------------+----------------+--------------+---------+---------------|
| Allow | Content-Encoding | Content-Length | Content-Type | Expires | Last-Modified |
|-------+------------------+----------------+--------------+---------+---------------|

Entity-Header fields define optional metainformation about the
Entity-Body or, if no body is present, about the resource identified
by the request.

Me: Clearly for a request Content-Length of the resource you are
GET'ing would be incorrect, so all are not valid without a body in a
request.
